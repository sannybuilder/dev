# Sanny Builder

Sanny Builder is a fast and powerful tool designed for the GTA 3D game series. It includes a disassembler, permitting the end-user to transform the game scripts into text and a compiler to translate source code written in the [custom language](https://docs.sannybuilder.com/coding) back into the binary form readable by the game. Sanny Builder also offers a convenient editor with a large number of useful functions such as syntax highlighting, error checking, advanced search tools, player coordinates reading, fast movement through code and much more.

This repository aims to collect users feedback and progress made by the development team.
